# TRANSCOM
Transcom model intercomparison for carbonyl sulfide
Aim of the TRANSCOM experiment: Quantify the impact of transport errors versus emissions on the representation of tropospheric variability
Focus: Inter-hemispheric gradient and seasonality 
Observations: NOAA surface and airborn measurements
Ensemble of python scripts used for the paper :  "Intercomparison of atmospheric Carbonyl Sulfide (TransCom-COS; Part one): Evaluating the impact of transport and emissions on tropospheric variability using ground-based and aircraft data" submitted in JGT
