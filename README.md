# TRANSCOM

Transcom model intercomparison experiment for carbonyl sulfide

Goal of the experiment: 
                        (1) Quantify the impact of transport errors versus emissions on the representation of tropospheric variability
                        (2) Assess the state of the art of the atmospheric budget of Carbonyl Sulfide.

Scripts compared the simulated and observed Inter-hemispheric gradient, seasonal cycle. 

Observations: NOAA surface and airborne measurements
